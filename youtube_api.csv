What is Deep Learning? Deep Learning Vs Machine Learning | Complete Deep Learning Course,"Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data through the composition of increasingly complex features.

Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning:

Depth of Representation: Deep Learning involves deep neural networks with multiple layers, allowing it to learn intricate features automatically.
Feature Engineering: Deep Learning often eliminates the need for manual feature engineering as it learns hierarchical representations.
Task Complexity: While both are used for various tasks, Deep Learning excels in complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
Data Requirements: Deep Learning models typically require more data for training.

What is a Perceptron? Perceptron Vs Neuron | Perceptron Geometric Intuition,"Code - https://github.com/campusx-official/100-days-of-deep-learning/tree/main/day3

A Perceptron is a simple type of artificial neural network algorithm developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. It's the basic unit of a neural network, taking multiple binary inputs and producing a single binary output. It computes a weighted sum of its input, applies an activation function, and produces an output.

Perceptron vs. Neuron:

Perceptron: Refers specifically to the algorithm developed by Rosenblatt, typically using a step function as the activation.
Neuron: A more general term used in the context of biological and artificial neural networks. It encompasses various activation functions beyond the step function.

Perceptron Trick | How to train a Perceptron | Perceptron Part 2 |  Deep Learning Full Course,"Code - https://github.com/campusx-official/100-days-of-deep-learning/tree/main/day4

Digital Notes for Deep Learning: https://shorturl.at/NGtXg

Training a Perceptron involves adjusting its weights to correctly classify input data. The process typically follows these steps:

Initialize Weights: Set initial weights randomly.
Forward Pass: Compute the weighted sum of inputs and pass it through an activation function.
Calculate Error: Compare the predicted output with the actual target.
Update Weights: Adjust weights based on the error using a learning rate and the gradient descent algorithm.
Repeat: Iterate through the dataset multiple times (epochs) until the model converges.

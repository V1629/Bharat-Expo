What is Machine Learning? | 100 Days of Machine Learning,"Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

In this video, we will discuss what Machine Learning is and how it has evolved over the years.

AI Vs ML Vs DL for Beginners in Hindi,"AI is an umbrella discipline that covers everything related to making machines smarter. Machine Learning (ML) is commonly used along with AI but it is a subset of AI. ML refers to an AI system that can self-learn based on the algorithm. Systems that get smarter and smarter over time without human intervention are ML. Deep Learning (DL) is a machine learning (ML) applied to large data sets. Most AI work involves ML because intelligent behavior requires considerable knowledge.

Hi, my name is Nitish Singh and you are welcome to my YouTube channel. In this video, discuss the concept of Batch Machine Learning, we will also discuss Offline Vs Online Machine Learning.

Batch Machine Learning: In the machine learning world, offline learning refers to situations where the program is not operating and taking in new information in real-time. Instead, it has a static set of input data. The opposite is online learning, where the machine learning program is working in real-time on data that comes in. From this video, we will learn the pros and cons of batch machine 
learning.

Online Machine Learning | Online Learning | Online Vs Offline Machine Learning,"Online learning is a common technique used in areas of machine learning where it is computationally infeasible to train over the entire dataset, requiring the need for out-of-core algorithms. It is also used in situations where it is necessary for the algorithm to dynamically adapt to new patterns in the data, or when the data itself is generated as a function of time, e.g., stock price prediction. Online learning algorithms may be prone to catastrophic interference, a problem that can be addressed by incremental learning approaches.

Instance-Based Vs Model-Based Learning | Types of Machine Learning,"The Machine Learning systems which are categorized as instance-based learning are the systems that learn the training examples by heart and then generalize to new instances based on some similarity measure. It is called instance-based because it builds the hypotheses from the training instances. It is also known as memory-based learning or lazy learning. The time complexity of this algorithm depends upon the size of training data. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O (n), where n is the number of training instances.

A system is called model-based when it learns from the data and creates a model, which has some parameters and it predicts the output by using this data trained model.

In this role, you will be the senior-most in a team and should have deep expertise in machine learning, statistics, and data handling. You will be responsible for developing actionable business insights after they get inputs from Data Analysts and Data Engineers. You should have the skill-set of both data analyst and data engineer. However, in the case of a data scientist, the skill sets need to be more in-depth and exhaustive.

A Data Analyst occupies an entry-level role in a data analytics team. In this role, you need to be adept at translating numeric data into a form that can be understood by everyone in an organization. Moreover, you need to have required proficiency in several areas, including programming languages such as python, tools such as excel, fundamentals of data handling, reporting, and modeling.  With enough experience under your belt, you can gradually progress from a data analyst to assume the role of a data engineer and a data scientist. 

Data Engineers are the intermediary between data analysts and data scientists. As a data engineer, you will be responsible for the pairing and preparation of data for operational or analytical purposes. A lot of experience in the construction, development, and maintenance of the data architecture will be demanded from you for this role. Usually, in this role, you will get to work on Big Data, compile reports on it, and send it to data scientists for analysis.

What are Tensors | Tensor In-depth Explanation | Tensor in Machine Learning,"A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices and is easily understood as a multidimensional array. In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor. A vector is a one-dimensional or first-order tensor and a matrix is a two-dimensional or second-order tensor. Tensor notation is much like matrix notation with a capital letter representing a tensor and lowercase letters with subscript integers representing scalar values within the tensor.  Many of the operations that can be performed with scalars, vectors, and matrices can be reformulated to be performed with tensors. As a tool, tensors and tensor algebra is widely used in the fields of physics and engineering. It is a term and set of techniques known in machine learning in the training and operation of deep learning models that can be described in terms of tensors.

Working with CSV files | Day 15 | 100 Days of Machine Learning,"The CSV file format is a popular format supported by many machine learning frameworks. The format is variously referred to ""comma-separated values"" or ""character-separated values.""

A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text form. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind. Each record consists of fields, separated by a literal comma. In some regions, the separator might be a semi-colon.

Typically, all records have an identical number of fields, and missing values are represented as nulls or empty strings. There are a number of ways to load a CSV file in Python.

Working with JSON/SQL | Day 16 | 100 Days of Machine Learning,"JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. JSON is a lightweight data format used for data interchange between multiple different languages. It is easy to read for humans and easily parsed by machines. It's pretty common for websites to return JSON from API's so that the information is easy to parse by different programming languages.

SQL(Structured Query Language) is used to manage relational databases, and It is used to perform fetching rows, database creation, modifying databases, deleting databases, and also reading, writing data. It is extremely useful in managing structured data, i.e. data that is used to represent relations among entities and variables. SQL is predicated on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus. MS Access, MySQL is a standard database language.

Working with JSON/SQL involves handling structured data in JSON format or querying relational databases using SQL, essential skills for data manipulation and analysis.

Understanding Your Data | Day 19 | 100 Days of Machine Learning,"Quality data is fundamental to any data science engagement. To gain actionable insights, the appropriate data must be sourced and cleansed. Understanding Your Data is the foundational step in any data analysis, involving exploring data characteristics, patterns, and relationships to gain insights.

It is important at the beginning of a project to consider potential harms from your tool. These harms can be caused by designing for only a narrow group of users, having insufficient representation of sub-populations, or human labelers favoring a privileged group.

Machine learning discovers and generalizes patterns in the data and could, therefore, replicate bias. If a group is under-represented, the machine learning model has fewer examples to learn from, resulting in reduced accuracy for those individuals in this group.

When implementing these models at scale, it can result in a large number of biased decisions, harming a large number of people. Ensure you have evaluated risks and have techniques in place to mitigate them.

EDA using Univariate Analysis | Day 20 | 100 Days of Machine Learning,"The preliminary analysis of data to discover relationships between measures in the data and to gain an insight on the trends, patterns, and relationships among various entities present in the data set with the help of statistics and visualization tools is called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 

Exploratory data analysis is cross-classified in two different ways where each method is either graphical or non-graphical. And then, each method is either univariate, bivariate or multivariate.

Uni means one and variate means variable, so in univariate analysis, there is only one dependable variable. The objective of the univariate analysis is to derive the data, define and summarize it, and analyze the pattern present in it. In a dataset, it explores each variable separately. It is possible for two kinds of variables- Categorical and Numerical.

Exponentially Weighted Moving Average or Exponential Weighted Average | Deep Learning,"Exponentially Weighted Moving Average  is a very important concept to understand Optimization in Deep Learning. It means that as we move forward, we simultaneously calculate the average of the points. In Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, we consider a few points, calculate their approximate weighted average, and then plot the graph. Then consider the next point as we move forward in time, calculate its approximate weighted average of the new set of points, and then again plot the graph and so on.

The catch here is that we are calculating the weighted average, and it means that, we give more weight to some points and less weight to others.

Optimization in Deep Learning like Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam can only be implemented with the help of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average. Thus it is very important to understand it.

SGD with Momentum Explained in Detail with Animations | Optimizers in Deep Learning Part 2,"In this video, we will understand in detail what is Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning is a technique that reduces the time taken to train a model.  The path of learning in mini-batch gradient descent is zig-zag, and not straight. Thus, some time gets wasted in moving in a zig-zag direction. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning smooths out the zig-zag path and makes it much straighter, thus reducing the time taken to train the model.

Momentum Optimizer uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, which averages out the vertical movement and the net movement is mostly in the horizontal direction. Thus zig-zag path becomes straighter.

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) Explained in Detail | Animations | Optimizers in Deep Learning,"The acceleration of momentum can overshoot the minima at the bottom of basins or valleys. Nesterov momentum is an extension of momentum that involves calculating the decaying moving average of the gradients of projected positions in the search space rather than the actual positions themselves.

This has the effect of harnessing the accelerating benefits of momentum whilst allowing the search to slow down when approaching the optima and reduce the likelihood of missing or overshooting it.

CNN Part 3 | Convolution Operation,"Convolution is one of the main building blocks of a CNN. The term convolution refers to the mathematical combination of two functions to produce a third function. It merges two sets of information.

In the case of a CNN, the convolution is performed on the input data with the use of a filter or kernel (these terms are used interchangeably) to then produce a feature map.

We execute a convolution by sliding the filter over the input. At every location, matrix multiplication is performed and sums the result onto the feature map.

What is Deep Learning? Deep Learning Vs Machine Learning | Complete Deep Learning Course,"Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). It is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data through the composition of increasingly complex features.

Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning:

Depth of Representation: Deep Learning involves deep neural networks with multiple layers, allowing it to learn intricate features automatically.
Feature Engineering: Deep Learning often eliminates the need for manual feature engineering as it learns hierarchical representations.
Task Complexity: While both are used for various tasks, Deep Learning excels in complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
Data Requirements: Deep Learning models typically require more data for training.

What is a Perceptron? Perceptron Vs Neuron | Perceptron Geometric Intuition,"Code - https://github.com/campusx-official/100-days-of-deep-learning/tree/main/day3

Digital Notes for Deep Learning: https://shorturl.at/NGtXg

A Perceptron is a simple type of artificial neural network algorithm developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. It's the basic unit of a neural network, taking multiple binary inputs and producing a single binary output. It computes a weighted sum of its input, applies an activation function, and produces an output.

Perceptron vs. Neuron:

Perceptron: Refers specifically to the algorithm developed by Rosenblatt, typically using a step function as the activation.
Neuron: A more general term used in the context of biological and artificial neural networks. It encompasses various activation functions beyond the step function.

Perceptron Trick | How to train a Perceptron | Perceptron Part 2 |  Deep Learning Full Course,"Code - https://github.com/campusx-official/100-days-of-deep-learning/tree/main/day4

Digital Notes for Deep Learning: https://shorturl.at/NGtXg

Training a Perceptron involves adjusting its weights to correctly classify input data. The process typically follows these steps:

Initialize Weights: Set initial weights randomly.
Forward Pass: Compute the weighted sum of inputs and pass it through an activation function.
Calculate Error: Compare the predicted output with the actual target.
Update Weights: Adjust weights based on the error using a learning rate and the gradient descent algorithm.
Repeat: Iterate through the dataset multiple times (epochs) until the model converges.

Hinge Loss: Suitable for binary classification problems, encouraging correct classifications with a margin.
Binary Cross Entropy: Often used with sigmoid activation for binary classification, measuring the dissimilarity between predicted and actual probabilities.

Problem with Perceptron,"The problem with Perceptrons lies in their limitation to learn complex patterns and functions, especially those that are not linearly separable. A Perceptron is a single-layer neural network with binary outputs, and it can only solve problems where the data points are linearly separable. If the data is not linearly separable, a Perceptron cannot converge and find a solution.

Exponentially Weighted Moving Average or Exponential Weighted Average | Deep Learning,"Exponentially Weighted Moving Average  is a very important concept to understand Optimization in Deep Learning. It means that as we move forward, we simultaneously calculate the average of the points. In Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, we consider a few points, calculate their approximate weighted average, and then plot the graph. Then consider the next point as we move forward in time, calculate its approximate weighted average of the new set of points, and then again plot the graph and so on.

The catch here is that we are calculating the weighted average, and it means that, we give more weight to some points and less weight to others.

Optimization in Deep Learning like Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam can only be implemented with the help of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average. Thus it is very important to understand it.

SGD with Momentum Explained in Detail with Animations | Optimizers in Deep Learning Part 2,"In this video, we will understand in detail what is Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning is a technique that reduces the time taken to train a model.  The path of learning in mini-batch gradient descent is zig-zag, and not straight. Thus, some time gets wasted in moving in a zig-zag direction. Momentum Optimizer in Deep Learning smooths out the zig-zag path and makes it much straighter, thus reducing the time taken to train the model.

Momentum Optimizer uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, which averages out the vertical movement and the net movement is mostly in the horizontal direction. Thus zig-zag path becomes straighter.

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) Explained in Detail | Animations | Optimizers in Deep Learning,"The acceleration of momentum can overshoot the minima at the bottom of basins or valleys. Nesterov momentum is an extension of momentum that involves calculating the decaying moving average of the gradients of projected positions in the search space rather than the actual positions themselves.

This has the effect of harnessing the accelerating benefits of momentum whilst allowing the search to slow down when approaching the optima and reduce the likelihood of missing or overshooting it.

CNN Part 3 | Convolution Operation,"Convolution is one of the main building blocks of a CNN. The term convolution refers to the mathematical combination of two functions to produce a third function. It merges two sets of information.

In the case of a CNN, the convolution is performed on the input data with the use of a filter or kernel (these terms are used interchangeably) to then produce a feature map.

We execute a convolution by sliding the filter over the input. At every location, matrix multiplication is performed and sums the result onto the feature map.
